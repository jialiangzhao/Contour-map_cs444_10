## Notes
comment:In this assignment, we divide an image into many
 small pieces, and then group them into line segments by 
drawing the sides of a square. Finally draw them with lines
 or colors.


## Included files

## References
This is the additional part, in this part I will
add two buttons. The number of circles in the image 
will be reduced or increased according to the description 
on the button. Let each place have a more detailed 
distribution area.
